Starting as a Junior QA Engineer, you will begin with testing 
small project parts, study QA methods and principles, 
acquire necessary technical skills and become an IT professional. 
You will get the “field” knowledge and experience with Windows 
and Linux OS, VMware, vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization 
platforms, public clouds like Amazon and Azure, and much more.

Challenging tasks and the informal working environment in 
our QA Teams provide for rapid professional growth.
